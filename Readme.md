Weechat-Android relay client
==================================
This is a WeeChat relay client for Android.

This application is *not* a standalone an IRC client. It connects to WeeChat that has to be
running on a remote machine. If you are looking for a standalone IRC client for Android,
you will need to look elsewhere.
